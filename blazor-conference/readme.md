### Blazor History

### Blazor Server

## What files were created?

Several files were created in the BlazorApp directory, to give you a simple Blazor app that is ready to run.

- `Program.cs` is the entry point for the app that starts the server.
- `Startup.cs` is where you configure the app services and middleware.
- `App.razor` is the root component for the app.
- The `BlazorApp/Pages` directory contains some example web pages for the app.
- `BlazorApp.csproj` defines the app project and its dependencies.
